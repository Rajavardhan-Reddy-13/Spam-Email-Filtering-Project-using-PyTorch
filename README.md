# Spam-Email-Filtering-Project-using-PyTorch

This project implements a **binary classification system** that detects whether an email is **spam or not spam** using the [UCI Spambase dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase). The classifier is trained using **Logistic Regression** in both **PyTorch** and **Scikit-learn** to compare performance.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

- Implements logistic regression from scratch using **PyTorch**
- Compares accuracy with **Scikit-learn**‚Äôs logistic regression
- Performs **z-score normalization** for feature scaling
- Uses **custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader** for mini-batch training
- Plots training loss, test loss, and accuracy over epochs
- Visualizes spam vs legitimate prediction probabilities
